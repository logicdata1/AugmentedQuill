# The AI Chat Assistant

The AI Chat Assistant is your dedicated coordinator, sounding board, and editor. It sits in the right sidebar alongside your writing interface, ready to help whenever you get stuck. Toggle it open with the **AI** button at the far right of the header, or close it with **Hide**.

`[SCREENSHOT: The AI Chat Assistant panel open in the right sidebar next to the text editor]`

The Chat Assistant is powered by the <img src="assets/message-square.svg" alt="Message square icon" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> <img src="assets/swatches/blue.svg" alt="Blue swatch" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> **CHAT model**
<img src="assets/message-square.svg" alt="Message square icon" width="20" height="20" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> <img src="assets/swatches/blue.svg" alt="Blue swatch" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />, which you can spot by the blue halo around the panel. You can swap the CHAT provider at any time using the model selector in the header without opening Settings.

CHAT should not be treated as the model that writes final prose by itself. It manages workflow, metadata, Sourcebook state, and delegation. New story text should be handed to WRITING, and prose refinement or summary work should be handed to EDITING.

Each chat session is independent. CHAT can rely on the messages in the current session plus the project data it reads with tools, but starting a new chat does not carry over older chat conversations.

## Chat Panel Header

The header bar at the top of the chat panel shows the current session name and a row of icon buttons:

`[SCREENSHOT: Chat panel header showing the session title and all icon buttons]`

| Button             | Icon                                                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Delete session** | <img src="assets/trash-2.svg" alt="Trash icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />        | Permanently deletes the active chat session after confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **New Chat**       | <img src="assets/plus.svg" alt="Plus icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />            | Creates a new persistent chat session. Previous sessions are preserved in history.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Incognito Chat** | <img src="assets/ghost.svg" alt="Ghost icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />          | Creates or shows an ephemeral chat session that is not saved to disk and does not appear in the history list. Use this for sensitive brainstorming you don't want logged. The icon turns purple when an incognito session is currently active.         |
| **Chat History**   | <img src="assets/history.svg" alt="History icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />      | Shows or hides the **Chat History Panel** (see below).

## System Prompt Panel

Clicking the Chat Settings button reveals a panel below the header where you can customize the AI's persona for the current session:

| Element                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"System Instruction"** label | —                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **System prompt textarea**     | Editable text that is prepended to every message in this session as a system instruction. Use it to give the AI a specific role (e.g. "You are a harsh but fair literary editor specializing in noir fiction."). |
| **Cancel**                     | Closes the panel without saving changes.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Update Persona**             | Saves the new system instruction and closes the panel. The new persona takes effect on the next message.                                                                                                         |

## Message Composer

At the bottom of the chat panel is a two-part composer area:

| Element                                                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message textarea**                                                                                                                                              | Auto-growing text input. Press **Enter** to send, **Shift+Enter** to insert a newline without sending.                                              |
| **Send** button (round, <img src="assets/send.svg" alt="Send icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />)                                 | Submits the message. Disabled while the AI is generating a response.                                                                                |
| **Stop generation** (red <img src="assets/x.svg" alt="Close icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />, dashed border)                   | Appears while the AI is generating. Click it to immediately abort the streaming response. The partial response remains visible in the message list. |
| **Regenerate last response** (<img src="assets/edit-2.svg" alt="Refresh icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> dashed border button) | Re-runs the last AI request from scratch and replaces the previous response. Useful when the output was unsatisfactory.                             |

---

## Message List

Each message in the conversation shows:

- An **avatar badge** indicating the role: a person icon for your messages, a bot icon for AI responses, or a settings icon for system messages.
- The **message content**, rendered as formatted markdown for AI responses.
- On hover, **Edit** (<img src="assets/edit-2.svg" alt="Edit icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) and **Delete** (<img src="assets/trash-2.svg" alt="Trash icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) buttons appear in the corner of the bubble.

### Editing a Message

Click the Edit icon on any message to enter inline edit mode. A textarea replaces the message text, pre-filled with the current content. Make your changes, then:

- Click the **Save** (<img src="assets/save.svg" alt="Save icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) icon to commit the edit. The message updates and the AI side of the conversation may re-run if you edited a user message.
- Click the **Cancel** (<img src="assets/x.svg" alt="Cancel icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" />) icon to discard changes and revert.

### AI Thinking and Tool Calls

When the AI uses advanced reasoning or takes an action behind the scenes, a collapsible **tool section** appears inside the response bubble. Click the chevron to expand or collapse it. These sections can include:

| Section              | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thinking Process** | The model's internal reasoning steps before it produced the answer (shown only by reasoning-capable models).                                       |
| **Tool Calls**       | A JSON summary of every function the AI called (e.g. "create_sourcebook_entry", "update_story_summary"). Useful for debugging unexpected behavior. |
| **Stack Trace**      | Error information if a tool call failed.                                                                                                           |

### Web Search Results

When **Web Search** is enabled and the AI performs a search, the response includes a formatted Web Search Results card showing:

- The Globe icon and the search query.
- A list of result cards, each with a clickable **title link**, the source URL, and a text snippet.

If the AI visits a specific page, a **Visit Page result** card appears with the URL, the extracted page text (scrollable), and the size of the fetched content.

### AI Actions and Project Changes

The <img src="assets/message-square.svg" alt="Message Square icon" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> <img src="assets/swatches/blue.svg" alt="Blue swatch" width="16" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" /> Chat model can take actions directly inside your project (create characters, update summaries, manage chapters, generate images). When the AI creates a new project or switches context, a **Switch to New Project** button may appear inside the response, letting you load the changed project with one click.

---

## Tool Call Limit Dialog

To prevent runaway AI automation, AugmentedQuill monitors how many consecutive tool calls the AI makes. If the count reaches the limit, a dialog pauses execution:

`[SCREENSHOT: Tool Call Limit dialog showing the call count and the three action buttons]`

| Button                     | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continue (+10 calls)**   | Allows 10 more tool calls and resumes automatically.                                              |
| **Continue without limit** | Removes the cap entirely for this request (use with care for complex automation tasks).           |
| **Stop and review**        | Halts the tool-call chain immediately so you can inspect what happened and decide how to proceed. |

---

## How to Use the Chat

You can talk to the AI just like you would a human collaborator. Because it can read your [Story Metadata](04_chapters_and_books.md#story-metadata-panel), [Chapters](04_chapters_and_books.md), and [Sourcebook](05_sourcebook.md) through tools, it can rebuild the context it needs inside the current session.

### Conflict-first workflow

The AI can read and update chapter conflicts through tools (chapter metadata includes conflict descriptions and resolution plans). A good prompt is:

- "Review Chapter 2 conflicts and suggest one scene where the main unresolved conflict is raised in stakes."
- "Based on the current chapter conflicts, rewrite the next paragraph so the threat is more clear and the resolution path is foreshadowed."

Use the existing conflict list to keep the model focused on forward momentum and to avoid accidentally solving everything too early.

### Brainstorming

Stuck on a plot point? Ask the AI for ideas.
_Example:_ "I need a reason for my protagonist to leave their hometown. What are some inciting incidents that fit a fantasy setting?"

### Overcoming Writer's Block

Not sure how to start a scene?
_Example:_ "Write an opening paragraph for Chapter 3, where Sarah discovers the hidden letter. Make the tone suspenseful."

### Fact-Checking Your Own World

Forget a detail you established earlier?
_Example:_ "What color are the uniforms of the Royal Guard?" (The AI will check your Sourcebook and previous chapters.)

### Editing and Feedback

Want a second opinion?
_Example:_ "Read the last three paragraphs I wrote. Is the dialogue natural? How can I make the tension higher?"

### Targeted in‑chapter edits (marker + replacement tools)

If you want to insert or replace text in the middle of a chapter without rewriting the entire chapter, you can use a **marker** and the AI’s editing tools.

1. **Insert the marker `~~~` into your chapter** where you want new content to go.
2. Tell the AI something like:
   - "Insert a short scene at the `~~~` marker where the hero meets the rival."
   - "Replace the marker `~~~` with a paragraph of dialogue and action."

The system will automatically call the right tool (insert_text_at_marker) to replace just the marker location and keep the rest of your chapter unchanged.

If you want to apply multiple small edits at once (search/replace style), the AI can also use tools like:

- **replace_text_in_chapter** (safe single replacement)
- **apply_chapter_replacements** (multiple replacements in one operation)

### Workflow Guidance

CHAT is especially useful when you want the app to follow the recommended story-building flow: notes first, then title and style tags, then the preliminary story summary, then Sourcebook work, then chapter notes and conflicts, and finally prose drafting. For a short story that usually means a single chapter; for a novel it means a flat chapter list; for a series it usually means working book by book. This sequence is flexible: CHAT can loop backward and repair earlier metadata whenever a later chapter exposes a gap.

## AI Actions

The AI isn't just a chatbot — it can take actions within your project. You can ask it to:

- "Create a new character profile for a grumpy bartender named Moe."
- "Summarize Chapter 1 and update the Story Summary."
- "Generate an image of the Crystal Castle based on my Sourcebook description."
- "Create a new chapter called 'The Betrayal' after Chapter 3."
- "Add a conflict to Chapter 2: Elena knows about the letter but hasn't told anyone."
- "Review current chapter conflicts and propose one unresolved conflict for the next chapter that fits story goals."
- "Use the conflict list to craft the next scene so the main problem stays unsolved but escalates stakes."

When those actions involve prose, CHAT should orchestrate them instead of writing the text itself.
